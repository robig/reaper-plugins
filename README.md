# my reaper plugins 

Reaper is a DAW, see reaper.fm

## midi_CC_mapper
Maps incoming midi CC commands from 2 sources to on CC target using one source for incrementing and one for decrementing a internal value that is sent to the target on change.

I'me unsing this plugin in Reaper connecting my iRig (R) BlueBoard (R) to my Helix Native (R) witching snapshots.
